Configuration
-------------

There are a lot of things I need to configure when on a new computer, and I find myself doing this frequently. This repo is a reference for setting everything up the way I like it. If you are not me and want to use a similar setup, I'm all for that.

### Installation

This setup is intended to work only on OSX, and has been tested with OSX Mavericks and up. If you are not running OSX or are running an old version, things _might_ not work, so be careful. Also, upgrade your OS.

Installing this in full will replace settings for your terminal, sublime text, adium, a number of osx system settings, and your desktop background, and will install a number of apps and binaries. If you don't want some of these things to happen, it might be better to back your stuff up or manually install individual sections, which is described below.

To install everything, clone this repo and run `make install`. To update and sync with changes, you can run `conf update`.
